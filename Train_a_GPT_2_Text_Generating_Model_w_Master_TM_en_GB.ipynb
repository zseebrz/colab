            "The auditors assessed whether the Commission and Member States had addressed the main weaknesses identified in the 2007-2013 programming period: the lack of coherent and systematic EU rural development policy objectives, a fragmented governance structure and poor coordination with the Member States.\n",
            "In their work, the auditors examined whether the Commission and Member States had put in place the infrastructure necessary to implement the EU rural development policy effectively and efficiently, and whether they had put in place relevant and relevant monitoring and evaluation systems.\n",
            "The auditors concluded that there was no evidence that EU funding had contributed effectively to improving governance and management in the Member States and that the implementation of the policy was largely successful.\n",
            "They also concluded that the 2007-2013 programming period was largely ineffective in improving governance and management, as Member States did not have the necessary capacity and political will to implement the rural development policy and the Commission did not take sufficient action to facilitate its implementation.\n",
